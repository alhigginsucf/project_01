# 3 Hermanos Brewery Website
Alexander Higgins
Concept: 3 Hermanos Brewery-Urban themed brewery utlizing a cool set of geometric design and patterns for can labels and body background image.
Technology Used: HTML5, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap.
The overall content was created using HTML. The webpage was given additional styling using CSS.
Bootstrap allowed simple creation of a Nav Bar, Carousel, image gallery and jumbotron effects.
I imported several different font-families from google/fonts. I was able to use a friends artistic images for the majority of the images.
Improvements: 1-I would've liked to included a better looking column and row of text. 2- I would have liked to integrate a bit more JavaScript. 
3- Would have liked to make my forms a little more organized.
